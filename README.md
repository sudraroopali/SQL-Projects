# SQL
For these projects, I have used MySQL. The projects here are designed to use SQL queries to find the various insights from given data. The goal was to clearly understand the structure of each table and the relationships among them using the ER diagrams and write complex join queries to get the relevant datasets. Thereafter to get insights on the data using various queries like sorting queries, aggregation queries, ranking queries, window functions etc.

## PROJECTS

### 1. Exploring cricket data 
The project showcased expertise in data analysis, SQL querying, and data manipulation. Analyzed the ICC Test Batting Figures dataset to formulate optimal batting orders for the top 6 players using various selection criteria. Utilized SQL queries and data manipulation techniques to extract relevant information and generate insights on player demographics

### 2. Exploring supplychain data 
Implemented advanced SQL queries to analyze the sales data of a company, focusing on the amount saved in each order through discounted rates. Utilized joins between the product and order item tables to calculate the savings and sorted the results in descending order, displaying the orders with the highest amount saved. This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL querying, data manipulation, and analysis within the supply chain domain. By utilizing SQL to extract valuable insights and optimize supply chain operations, the project contributes to informed decision-making and improved business performance.

### 3. Exploring bank customers data 
This project involved leveraging SQL queries and data manipulation techniques to extract insights from the bank customer data. By analyzing account details, transactions, customer messages, and interest rates, I aimed to uncover valuable patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. These findings can contribute to enhancing customer experience, optimizing banking operations, and supporting data-driven decision-making within the banking domain.
